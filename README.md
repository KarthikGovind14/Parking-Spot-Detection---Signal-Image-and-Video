# Parking-Spot-Detection---Signal-Image-and-Video
This repository cointains all the material (code, report etc...) I developed for the Signal, Image & Video course project.

## Slides
In releases is available the final version of the slides.

## Algorithms implementations (Python)

In the root folder of this repo you can find the Jupyter notebook `skeletonizion.ipynb` in which the three algoritms presented in the slides are briefly described, implemented and compared.

In order to run it you need the following steps:
1. Have `python@3.11` installed in your machine.
2. Necessary dependency libraries (pickle, numpy) should be present.
3. The feed image & video should be of the same folder to access by the code.
4. Enjoy! 

## Output video of the project
In the folder `Output` the video of the working model can be found.`<Output>.mp4`.
